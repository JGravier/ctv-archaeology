[CRAN task view proposal](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/Proposal.md): Archaeology

_Scope_: This task view is a list of packages useful for many kinds of archaeological science. It includes packages widely used by archaeologists, packages for working with distinctive types of archaeological analyses, such as radiocarbon ages, artefact types and faunal remains, packages containing archaeological datasets, and packages from closely related sciences such as environmental science.  

_Packages_: Include a tentative list of packages for the task view. This should encompass the "core" packages and a collection of relevant packages, ideally grouped by sections within the topic. It is not important, yet, that the list of sections or packages is already exhaustive.

_Overlap_: This task view has very little overlap with existing CTVs because many of the packages listed here were developed recently.
