[CRAN task view proposal](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/Proposal.md): Archaeology

_Scope_: This task view is a list of packages useful for archaeological science. It includes packages for working with distinctive types of archaeological data, such as radiocarbon ages, various types of artefacts (lithics, pottery, etc.), faunal remains, geoarchaeological and landscape data, packages containing archaeological datasets, and packages from closely related sciences, such as environmental science, that are widely used by archaeologists. This is a list to help archaeologists in their search for packages relevant to their research.

_Packages_: See [Archaeology.md](Archaeology.md).

_Overlap_: This task view has very little overlap with existing CTVs because many of the packages listed here are specialised for archaeological research and were developed recently. We have omitted many less specialised packages that archaeologists use often, but are already listed on other CTVs. A future CTV that is closely related could focus on biological anthropology and include data packages such as ryanraaum/qmdata and geanes/bioanth
