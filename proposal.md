[CRAN task view proposal](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/Proposal.md): Archaeology

_Scope_: Include one or two paragraphs about the scope of the task view, outlining the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as relevant sections within the topic.

_Packages_: Include a tentative list of packages for the task view. This should encompass the "core" packages and a collection of relevant packages, ideally grouped by sections within the topic. It is not important, yet, that the list of sections or packages is already exhaustive.

_Overlap_: Comment on potential overlap with already existing task views as well as with task views that might be created (or split off) in the future.

_Maintainers_: The proposal should be made by the person willing to act as the principal maintainer for the task view. Furthermore, task views should have teams of additional 1-5 co-maintainers and possible candidates for these can be listed as well in the proposal.
