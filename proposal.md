[CRAN task view proposal](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/blob/main/Proposal.md): Archaeology

_Scope_: This task view is a list of packages useful for many kinds of archaeological science. It includes packages widely used by archaeologists, packages for working with distinctive types of archaeological analyses, such as radiocarbon ages, artefact types and faunal remains, packages containing archaeological datasets, and packages from closely related sciences such as environmental science.  

_Packages_: See [Archaeology.md](Archaeology.md).

_Overlap_: This task view has very little overlap with existing CTVs because many of the packages listed here are specialised for archaeological research and were developed recently.

_Maintainers_: Principal maintainer: Ben Marwick, benmarwick@gmail.com, Co-maintainers:
