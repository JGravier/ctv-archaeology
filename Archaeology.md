This task view is a list of packages useful for many kinds of archaeological science. It includes packages widely used by archaeologists, packages for working with distinctive types of archaeological analyses, such as radiocarbon ages, artefact types and faunal remains, packages containing archaeological datasets, and packages from closely related sciences such as environmental science. 

Many relevant packages can also be found in other CRAN Task Views, especially [Environmetrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Environmetrics.html), [Spatial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html) [Multivariate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html), [Phylogenetics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html), [Cluster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Cluster.html), and [SpatioTemporal](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SpatioTemporal.html) task views.
